TITLE:
This study shows how the Association rule mining technique is used to analyse the 
relationship or connection of goods bought in a single purchase.

ABSTRACT:
Association Rule Mining is a powerful technique for uncovering relationships between variables in large datasets, often applied in domains like retail, e-commerce, and supply chain management.

This study demonstrates Market Basket Analysis, an application of Association Rule Mining, based on the principle that purchasing one set of items can indicate the likelihood of purchasing another set.

Using a transactional dataset, this project explores the relationships among items purchased, identifying patterns that provide actionable business insights.

METHODOLOGY:
Dataset Overview:
Format: Transactional
Transactions: 9,836
Unique Items: 10,036
Density: 0.0005392746

Key Observations:
The most frequently purchased items:
Whole milk: 2,513 purchases
Other vegetables: 1,903 purchases
Rolls and buns: 1,809 purchases
Soda: 1,715 purchases
Yoghurt: 1,372 purchases

Data Inspection
The dataset was inspected and preprocessed using the following R commands:
#inspect dataset
head(groc)
tail(groc)
names(groc)
str(groc)
summary(groc)
dim(groc)

# Remove unnecessary columns and export cleaned data
groc$Item.s. <- NULL
write.csv(groc, 'C:/Users/fortu/Downloads/groc.csv')

Transaction Format Conversion
The dataset was read into R in transactional format:
#read dataset in transactions format
groc_t <- read.transactions('C:/Users/fortu/Downloads/groc.csv', format 
= 'basket',
 sep = ',')
summary(groc_t)

Frequent Item Analysis
#plot item frequency
itemFrequencyPlot(groc_t,topN = 20, type ='absolute', col = 
brewer.pal(3,'Pastel1'))

Building Association Rules
The Apriori Algorithm was applied to generate rules with the following parameters:
#create model
groc_rules <- apriori(groc_t,parameter = list(supp = 0.001, conf = 0.7)) 
groc_rules
summary(groc_rules)

sort(groc_rules,by = 'confidence', decreasing = T)

inspect(groc_rules[1:20])

Rule Visualization
Rules were explored interactively using ruleExplorer:
ruleExplorer(groc_rules)
