TITLE:
This study shows how the Association rule mining technique is used to analyse the 
relationship or connection of goods bought in a single purchase.

ABSTRACT:
Association Rule Mining is a typical method for discovering connections between a large number of variables from food stores, 
local shops, e-commerce businesses and anyone with a large business transactions database usually utilise it.

Market Basket Analysis is a modelling approach founded on the idea that if you buy one set of items, 
there's a high probability that you're likely to buy another set.

Read the dataset in transactional format. This shows it has 9836 columns of transactions, 
10036 columns of items and a density of 0.0005392746.
It also shows the most frequently bought item as whole milk which accounts for 2513, 
other vegetables 1903, rolls and buns 1809, soda 1715 and yoghurt 1372 as seen on the image below.
